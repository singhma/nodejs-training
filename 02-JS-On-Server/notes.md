# JS on Server
- JS on Server + JS on Client gave birth to the term Full Stack and framework like MERN and MEAN came into existence as same developer can do client / server side coding using Node JS 

- Node JS uses chrome v8 JS engine which is written in [c++](https://github.com/v8/v8)

- Node JS is a c++ application with v8 engine embedded into it

## What is v8 engine
- V8 is [Googleâ€™s](https://v8.dev/) open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js
- implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly
- runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems
- `v8 engine can be embedded into any c++ application, this is the reason that led to the invention of nodejs`
- job of v8 engine is to execute javascript code
    - when you write some javascript code ==> code is read by v8 engine (c++ program) ==> converted into machine level code ==> gets executed by the machine


> [!IMPORTANT]

> why was there a need of nodejs, when v8 can execute any js code or, why cant we just have v8 engine on any server and run javascript code there?
